IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THE TERMS OF OUR PRIVACY POLICY, DO NOT USE THIS WEBSITE OR THE SERVICES.

1. **The Service.** The Forestry.io provides a website hosting, website management and website publishing subscription service targeted towards developers and programmers (the **"Service"**). We offer a tiered pricing model depending on how many websites you are managing and how many users you need to access the account, as is more fully described in the Subscription Accounts section below.

1. **Registration.** You must be at least eighteen (18) years old to register for an account. If you are registering for a paid subscription account, you must also have a valid credit card. When you register, you will be required to provide your first and last name, an email address and create a password. All personal information that you provide to us will be treated in accordance with the terms of our privacy policy, which you should read carefully. You are responsible for all activity occurring on your account, so please choose a strong password and do not share it with any other person. Please notify us immediately if you become aware or suspect that your account has been compromised.

1. **Subscription Accounts.** Once you have registered for an account, you will be prompted to choose the type of account you want, i.e. free or paid. We offer a range of account options including a free account for unlimited websites and one user, an account that provides hosting services for unlimited websites, and account access for five users, to an unlimited account that provides hosting for unlimited websites and account access to unlimited users. The pricing for our various subscriptions is found on the pricing page of our website. If you choose an account that provides hosting services for multiple websites, and access for multiple users, you will be required to select and account administrator (**"Administrator"**). Administrators are responsible for granting other users access to the account, and can do so by inputting the name and email address of the individual and sending an invitation to use the Service. For greater you may only have one account per person. If we discover that you have registered for multiple free accounts, we reserve the right to terminate your access to the services immediately and without notice.

1. **Using the Services.** Once you have registered for an Account and chosen your subscription plan, you will be able to import your project into the Website, either by dragging a zip file, or importing from another service such as GitHub. Once you have uploaded your website and files to your account, you will be able to manage your website via the Services.

1. **Content.** All information, data, text, software, music, sound, photographs, graphics, files, videos, messages or other materials, whether publicly posted or privately transmitted to the Website by Users (**"User Content"**), is the sole responsibility of such Users. This means that Users, and not Forestry.io, are entirely responsible for all such material uploaded, posted, emailed, transmitted or otherwise made available by using the Service. Forestry.io does not control or actively monitor User Content and, as such, does not guarantee the accuracy, integrity or quality of such content. Under no circumstances will Forestry.io be liable in any way for any materials, including, but not limited to, materials that infringe third party rights, for any errors or omissions in any materials or any defects or errors in any printing or manufacturing, or for any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of the viewing or use of any materials posted, emailed, transmitted or otherwise made available via the Service.

1. **Restrictions on User Content and Use of the Service.** Forestry.io reserves the right at all times (but will have no obligation) to remove or refuse to distribute any User Content and to terminate users or reclaim usernames or suspend or restrict account access for violations of these Terms of Use. We also reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information as we reasonably believe is necessary to (i) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request, (ii) enforce these Terms of Use, including investigation of potential violations hereof, (iii) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, (iv) respond to user support requests, or (v) protect the rights, property or safety of our users and the public.
