## Why did you add a `.forestryio` file?
We add a file called `.forestryio` to the root of your project. 

This file notifies Forestry that you have previously published to this location and that it is safe to publish to this location again.

## Why did you add a `.forestry` folder?
We add a folder called `.forestry` to the root of your project with the [code configuration](/docs/settings/config-files/) of your site. 

This enables developers to edit the configuration of the CMS in their local environment, and keep changes to the configuration in version control.
