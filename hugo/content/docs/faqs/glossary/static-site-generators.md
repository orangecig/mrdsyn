Static Site Generators are developer tools that convert various data formats into [static sites](/docs/faqs/glossary/static-sites).

These data formats are generally [content files](/docs/faqs/glossary/content-files/) stored in a Git repository. They can also be data pulled from third-party services.

## Examples
- [**Jekyll**](https://jekyllrb.com) is the static site generator written in Ruby and created by [GitHub](https://github.com) founder, Tom Preston Werner.
- [**Hugo**](https://gohugo.io) is the static site generator written in GoLang and created by Steve Francia.
