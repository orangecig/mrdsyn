## Overview

Forestry supports _outgoing webhooks_ to notify third-party applications about events that occur in Forestry. This allows developers to trigger custom deployments, send out notifications, and much more.

## Events that support webhooks

* When your site is published
* When your site is imported

## What can you do with a webhook?

* Trigger cache invalidation every time someone publishes your site
* Trigger a custom build script when someone publishes your site

## Setting up webhooks

Navigate to the _Settings_ page in the CMS, and under _Webhook URL_ specify the URL endpoint that you want outgoing webhooks to post to.

## Webhook format

Forestry will make a post to your URL with a JSON payload. For example:

    {
        "event": "post_publish",
        "success": true,
        "error": null
    }​

If there is an error, the `success` parameter will be set to `false`, and the `error` parameter will provide the error message. For example:

    {
        "event": "post_publish",
        "success": false,
        "error": "FTP credentials incorrect"
    }​
