To save time when creating your Content Model, you can base new Front Matter Templates off the data found in an existing page.

To do so, navigate to that page and click the _settings_ drop down. From there, you can choose "Create Template" which will create a Front Matter Template based off that page's front matter data.

Naviage to the Front Matter Templates section of your website to find that template there. Ensure the name is appropriate and begin to edit the fields.

Finally, go back to the original page and from the same settings menu, select **Change Template** and select your newly created Front Matter Template.
