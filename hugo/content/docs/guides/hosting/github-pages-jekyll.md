## Using Jekyll with GitHub Pages
GitHub can handle building your Jekyll site without the need of Forestry or a CI tool. GitHub will build your Jekyll site each time a new commit is pushed to GitHub and serve it automatically.

### Limitations
When using GitHub to build your GitHub Pages site, you are restricted to using the [white-listed GitHub Pages Jekyll version and plugins](https://pages.github.com/versions/).

## Getting Started
This requires the GitHub pages gem. Enable it by adding the following line to your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem "github-pages", group: :jekyll_plugins
```

![github pages settings](/uploads/2017/12/branch-management.png)

Next, head over to the *Settings* page of your repository in GitHub, and scroll down to *GitHub Pages*. Set the *Source* option to "master branch" and click *Save*.

Note the URL listed at the top of the GitHub Pages settings. This is the URL that your GitHub Pages site will be served from.

Lastly, in Forestry navigate to the *Settings* page, click the *Hosting* tab, and set the *Connection* option to *Commit to source repo only*.

Your Jekyll site will now be re-built by GitHub each time a commit is pushed to your repository.

{{% tip Troubleshooting %}}
Your `_config.yml` file must reside in the root of your repository for GitHub Pages to build your site.
