If you’re planning on using any preprocessing on your assets (images, CSS, or JS) you’ll need to be careful how you implement this as it effects how Forestry builds your sites. 

## SASS

Jekyll supports `.sass` and `.scss` processing out of the box. It requires special configuration, so please see Jekyll’s docs on asset processing in the resources below.

## CoffeeScript

Jekyll also supports preprocessing CoffeeScript with an officially support gem. It requires special configuration, so please see Jekyll’s docs on asset processing in the resources below.

## Best Practises for Gulp, Grunt, and Other Build Tools

Forestry does not currently support external build tools in the build process.

When publishing, previewing, or saving drafts, Forestry will *only* run:
`jekyll build`

If you use Gulp, Grunt or another build tool to process your assets, you *must* commit your final working assets to your repository, otherwise [previewing](/docs/editing/previews) and [deployment](/docs/hosting) will **not** work.
