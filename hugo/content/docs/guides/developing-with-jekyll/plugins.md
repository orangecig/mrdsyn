Jekyll allows you to add Gem-based plugins using your `Gemfile`. This allows you to add things like \[CoffeeScript\]\[1\] preprocessing.

## Installing Plugins

Forestry supports all third-party Jekyll plugins, and installs them in the same manner they are installed in your \[local environment\]\[2\].

Installation generally has three steps:

1. Add the plugin to your `Gemfile`. If you do not have a `Gemfile`, you must create one in your project root.

        source 'https://rubygems.org'
        gem 'jekyll'
        group :jekyll_plugins do
          gem 'jekyll-menus'
        end
2. You must also add the plugin to the `gems` array in your Jekyll `_config.yml`.

        plugins:
        - jekyll-menus
3. Install the plugin and run Jekyll by running the following commands:

        $ bundle install
        $ bundle exec jekyll serve

**Note:** depending on the plugin, additional configuration may be required. Please read each pluginâ€™s documentation carefully.
