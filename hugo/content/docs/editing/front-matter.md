## What is Front Matter?

Front Matter is structured metadata that lives at the top of your [content files](/docs/faqs/glossary/content-files/) that allows you to add custom variables to your pages. Depending on your static site generator, Front Matter can be defined in a variety of formats including [YAML](/docs/faqs/glossary/front-matter#yaml), [TOML](/docs/faqs/glossary/front-matter#toml), and [JSON](/docs/faqs/glossary/front-matter#json).

For example, YAML Front Matter may look like this:

```yaml

## Welcome to the homepage!
Thanks for visiting our site!
```

Forestry provides a simple and intuitive editor for Front Matter, for both [Markdown](/docs/editing/markdown-editor/) and [HTML documents](/docs/editing/html-editor/).

Forestry offers a variety of UI elements called [_Front Matter Fields_](/docs/settings/fields/) that allow editors to easily update Front Matter. When importing your site, Forestry will try to choose the best _Front Matter Field_ for each _Front Matter value_.

{{% tip %}} You can customize the _Front Matter Fields_ of a page using Forestry's [_Front Matter Templates_](/docs/settings/front-matter-templates/). These templates allow fields to be ordered and configured in a variety of ways such as making them required, setting default values, adding descriptions, and much more! {{% /tip %}}
