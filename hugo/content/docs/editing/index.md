Forestry allows editors to manage their website in a variety of different ways. This enables developers to build powerful, static sites while empowering editors to take full control over their content.

![](/uploads/2018/01/10.png)

## Pages

The most basic type of content in Forestry is a page. Pages are any ungrouped content in your static site, such as an about page or contact page. They appear in the _Pages_ collection under _Content_ in the sidebar.

{{% tip %}}
In **Hugo**, pages are any [content files](/docs/faqs/glossary/content-files/) stored inside of the root of the `content/` folder.
In **Jekyll**, these are any [content files](/docs/faqs/glossary/content-files/) that are not part of a [Jekyll collection](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/collections/).

## Collections

Collections are grouped content in your static site. These are feeds or hierarchies of content, such as blog posts or landing pages. They appear under _Content_ in the sidebar.

{{% tip %}}
In **Hugo**, these are any folders inside of the `content/` folder, called [sections](https://gohugo.io/content-management/sections/).
In **Jekyll**, these are [content files](/docs/faqs/glossary/content-files/) that are part of a [Jekyll collection](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/collections/).

## Data Files

[Data files](/docs/editing/data-files/) are special content files that aren't rendered as HTML pages in your built site. They are used for adding rich metadata site-wide, like authors or company information. They appear under _Data_ in the sidebar.

Learn more about using data files with [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/templates/data-templates/) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/datafiles/) in their documentation sites.

## Searching Content

Pages, collections, and data files can all be searched by the `title` field and by filename.
