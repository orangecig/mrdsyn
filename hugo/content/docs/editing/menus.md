Menus allow content editors to easily manage existing menus in your site, such as site navigation and sidebars using a simple drag-and-drop interface.

## Adding New Menus

Forestry will automatically display menus found in your site, and allow content editors to manage menu items from existing content in your site, or to external links on the internet.

### Using with Hugo

The Menu Manager integrates directly with Hugo's menu system. See [Hugo's documentation](https://gohugo.io/content-management/menus/) on setting up your first menu.

Menu entries linking to existing content on your site will be added to the front matter of that content.

Menu entries with external links will be added to your Hugo site config file.

### Using with Jekyll

The Menu Manager integrates directly with the [Jekyll Menus plugin](https://github.com/forestryio/jekyll-menus).

Menu entries linking to existing content on your site will be added to the front matter of that content.

Menu entries with external links will be added to your menus data file located at `/data/menus.yml`.

## Managing Menus

The Menu Manager allows you to add, reorganize, and remove menu items from existing menus.

If your site supports them, sub-menus can easily be created by dragging a menu item underneath another menu item! Give it a try!
