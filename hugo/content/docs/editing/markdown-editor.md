The markdown editor is the main way of editing content in Forestry. Your content's [front matter](/docs/settings/front-matter-templates/) is shown on the left, and your content's markdown body is shown on the right.

An editing environment based on markdown allows for fast formatting and a seamless authoring experience, which focuses entirely on the content being created. Markup is translated to visual formatting on-the-fly to provide the best experience possible.

## Markdown formatting

The markdown editor works just like any other online WYSIWYG editor. A full toolbar is available at the bottom of the editor for easy formatting. Markdown is supported to allow for fast formatting and a familiar experience for developers.

The markdown editor is fully [commonmark compatible](http://commonmark.org/help/)! Give markdown a try by typing `## My New Heading!` into the editor to get a level 2 heading!

To find all available keyboard and markdown shortcuts, click the keyboard icon in the bottom right corner.

For advanced users, the full markdown source of your content body can be edited by clicking "view source" in the top right corner.

## Drafting and Publishing Content

The markdown editor fully supports creating draft content -- content that is not yet ready to be published to your production website -- as well as live, published content.

This can be changed by clicking the more options icon (`...`), and clicking "Set as draft"/"Set as published".

## New File Format

By default, Forestry is [configured to create all new content](/docs/settings/#new-file-format) using the markdown editor.

## Front Matter Templates

The left-hand side of the markdown editor is your document's front matter. Forestry provides a powerful templating system for front matter, called [Front Matter Templates](/docs/front-matter-templates/).
