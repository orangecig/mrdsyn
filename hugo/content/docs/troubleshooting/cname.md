For some hosting providers (such as GitHub pages) you will need to place a `CNAME` file in the root of your site.

You'll need to ensure that the CNAME file is treated as a [static file](/docs/faqs/glossary/static-files), so that it is copied to the root of your site during the build.

{{% tip %}}
Make sure you place your `CNAME` file in your source directory, not your build directory. Otherwise it will be deleted during the next build

### Examples
- **Jekyll:** any file without [front matter](/docs/editing/front-matter) is treated as a static file, so place your `CNAME` file in the root of your source folder
- **Hugo**: any file inside of the `static/` directory in your source folder is treated as a static file.
