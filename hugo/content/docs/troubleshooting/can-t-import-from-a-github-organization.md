If you're trying to connect to a repository from your GitHub organization, ensure that you have enabled [3rd-party access](https://help.github.com/articles/approving-oauth-apps-for-your-organization/ "3rd-party access").

3rd-party access is restricted by default for new organizations, so you'll need to approve the Forestry app. This needs to be done for every organization that has repositories you want to access through Forestry.
