We’ve been hard at work this month at [Forestry.io,](https://forestry.io) focusing on improving the editing experience and overall usability of the application and we’re excited to announce that it’s already here! We’ve got 3 updates to share with you that will make using Forestry much more enjoyable.

## New Editor & Layout Improvements

We've built a new editor that makes editing your content much easier and so much more enjoyable. We've also improved the app's UI altogether. We wrote a blog about this not long ago, [check it out for more details](https://forestry.io/blog/post/bigger-better-editor)!

## Improved Front Matter & Front Matter Group Fields

We've drastically improved the field group and field group list Front Matter Fields with improved UI and editing flow as well as better form validation. This allows you to create complex front matter configurations and have an editing experience that is second-to-none.

## Toggle the WYSIWYG/Markdown Editor On Or Off

Do you have a page template that only utilizes markdown fields? We did! That’s why we've added the option to toggle the WYSIWYG/Markdown editor on or off in Front Matter Templates.

## What Now?

Do you have a CMS for your site already? If so, does it work well and give your team the proper inputs, validation, and usability you want? Forestry will, so [give it a try for free](https://app.forestry.io/signup).
