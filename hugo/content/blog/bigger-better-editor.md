For the past few weeks, Nichlas and Nolan have been hard at work on the Forestry content editor. We wanted to make the easiest-to-use, most configurable static site content editor ever built. With their hard work, we now have some big improvements to share that get us that much closer. We’ve built a new and improved editor that makes managing your site easier and more effective than ever before. Both on the desktop and on mobile devices.

### 1. Improved Two-Pane Interface

Most content management systems have a single column editor with all of your page management tools beside it. Inside of an extremely long column are all of your page fields and your page content. We don’t feel that this does the job well, especially for static sites that can have tons of front matter fields.

We’ve updated our editor with a two-pane interface that allows you to manage your front matter fields and your body content at the same time.

This lets you keep all of your content top of mind. This allows you to complete tasks like writing the best headline for your content, or keeping an eye on your keywords while you draft a page.

### 2. Fully-Featured & Focused Mobile Editor

Editing content on-the-go is something we always say we want to do, but we never do it because editing content on mobile usually sucks. We wanted to change that.

With the new two-pane interface, you get a fantastic experience on mobile. Instead of having a massive scrolling view, you get an experience like a native mobile application. You can move back and forth from your front matter fields to your content body with a single tap.

This means faster, more focused editing on mobile, with no sacrificed functionality.

### 3. Streamlined Tools

The other big problem we have with mobile editors is access to your page management tools. Either they’re all at the top of a long scroll view — always out of reach — or they’re all crammed into a single mobile menu.

We solved this problem with the new paneled editor view. Now, all of your management tools are scoped by the panel you’re looking at, and they’re always available no matter where on the page you are.

This means you have to think less about how to manage your content and can focus more on doing it.

## Improved Navigation Everywhere

</div>

We took what we learned from building our bigger, better editor and applied it to the rest of Forestry CMS.

You’ll find your account and site info now lives in the sidebar, as well as your notifications and view site button.

Elsewhere, navigation is now standardized and feels much like the editor. All to make your time using your CMS much easier and more effective.

## What Does This Mean For Your Website?

If your site is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) or [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) using static site technology, you can start using our new editor when it launches in June.

If you’re not using static site technology, we encourage you to [learn more about static sites](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/11/modern-static-website-generators-next-big-thing/). They’re the more modern, performant, and scalable way to build websites.

In a world where the average visitor leaves if your site doesn’t load in under 3 seconds, you’ve gotta be fast. Existing solutions like Wordpress or Drupal can make that challenging, and expensive.

Static sites make building fast, customizable websites dead simple. So don’t hesitate, [go out and learn](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/11/modern-static-website-generators-next-big-thing/)!
