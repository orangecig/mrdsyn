This week we’ve got a small, but very useful update we're excited to share with you.

## WYSIWYG Formatting in Textareas

<img src="/uploads/2017/12/WYSIWYG-preview.gif" draggable="true" data-bukket-ext-bukket-draggable="true">

Our textarea Front Matter field has been upgraded to allow for WYSIWYG input. Enjoy being able to add bold, italic, underline, and code formatting.

## Enable WYSIWYG for Textareas

You can enable the WYSIWYG features by enabling the “WYSIWYG” toggle on any textarea Front Matter field.

## Give Us Feedback

While the WYSIWYG features are inline only right now, we’re looking to develop this field into a truly powerful tool.

We’d love you feedback on this upgrade, including which functionality you’d like to see added in the future.
