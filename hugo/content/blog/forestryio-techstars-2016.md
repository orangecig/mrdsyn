We're stoked to announce that Forestry.io is going to be part of [Techstars NYC](http://www.techstars.com/startup-accelerator/).  The 90-day program runs from July until the end of September 2016.

What this means for Forestry and our users:

* We're going to be surrounded by some of the brightest minds in New York tech
* We get to focus intensly on making Forestry awesome for our users. Stoked to be working 15-hour days!
* Over $1,000,000 in [amazing "perks"](http://www.techstars.com/startup-accelerator/) (free stuff) from companies such as Amazon, Digital Ocean, Microsoft, Google, Sendgrid, etc.

We'll we're off to New York.
