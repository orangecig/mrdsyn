Does the following sound familiar?  You set up a WP site, hand it off to a non-dev, and then they point to some unused part of the UI and say:

<blockquote>
<p>"What does this do?"</p>
</blockquote>

To which you sheepishly reply:

<blockquote>
<p>"Oh, that doesn't do anything...just ignore it."</p>
</blockquote>

A CMS often feels like a work-around, designed for some other purpose.

## Front Matter Templates (FMTs)

FMTs allow you to customize the presentation of your UI fields in your CMS.

We're building a hackable CMS for Jekyll and Hugo sites. A CMS that allows you to strip out the non-essential clutter from your UI and [Front Matter Templates](https://forestry.io/docs/setting-up-a-site/front-matter-templates/) are the first step in this direction. This is handy if your pages use a lot of [front](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/) [matter](https://gohugo.io/content/front-matter/) fields.

## What you can do with FMTs

The following page makes use of a variety of front matter:

<span class="image-wrapper media-wrapper" contenteditable="false"></span>

<span class="image-wrapper media-wrapper" contenteditable="false"></span>

Astronomy compels the soul to look upward, and leads us from this world to another.
Dinosaurs are extinct today because they lacked opposable thumbs and the brainpower to build a space program.

With Front Matter Templates, you can do things like:

### Hide fields from your editors

### Change the field type in the UI

For example, change type from a list of tags to an image gallery. [See full list of available fields](https://forestry.io/docs/setting-up-a-site/front-matter-templates/#field-types).

## What's Next?

This is just the beginning. Soon we'll be adding more field types and more customizability.

### Coming soon: image resizing and cropping

### Coming soon: advanced UI fields

Like color pickers, google map location picker, etc.

### Coming soon: related fields

Select data from your elsewhere in your site. For example, choose a related post, or choose an author from a data file.

## Conclusion

[Front Matter Templates](https://forestry.io/docs/site-configuration/front-matter-templates/) allow you to customize the presentation of the fields in your CMS.  You can set up a template to be used for a single page or for a collection of pages (posts, projects, etc).  Customize the UI so non-developers aren't confused.

As always, if you have any thoughts or feedback, we'd love to hear from you!
