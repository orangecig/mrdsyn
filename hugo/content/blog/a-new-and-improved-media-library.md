We've got great improvements to share with you from Forestry.io, involving Forestry’s _Media Library_.

The Media Library allows content editors to easily upload images, videos, and much more without needing to understand Git.

## **Single Upload Directory**

We've received a lot of feedback from the community about which media should be displayed in the media library.

Forestry used to display media from all folders throughout the project. Not all of these folders are useful for your editors, and resulted in theme assets, favicons, and other media being displayed.

For this reason, we now restrict the Media Library to display only the media stored your site's "Upload Directory".

### What does this mean?

For existing sites in Forestry, the media library will now only show media files that are stored in the "Upload Folder", which can be changed in your Site's Settings.

By default, this folder is `/uploads/:year:/:month:/:day:/`.

If you don't store your media files in this location, updating the Upload Folder will update the Media Library to display media from the correct location!

If you have any questions, please reach out to [support@forestry.io](mailto: support@forestry.io) or in the #feature-requests channel of [Slack community](https://forestry.io/blog/post/join-our-slack-community/).

## Media Search

When browsing the media library, you can now search your media by file name.

We will continue to update the media library to make search more robust and powerful over the coming months.

### Search Images by Visual Content

Images can also be searched based on the visual contents of an image! This feature is in beta and will continue to be improved over the coming months.

## Performance Improvements

A series of performance improvements have released this week. Images are now paged and loaded as they come into view.

This will make large Media Libraries faster and much more responsive.
