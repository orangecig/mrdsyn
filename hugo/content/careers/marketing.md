### About Forestry.io

Forestry.io is a content management system (CMS) built for the next generation of the web. We're taking a new approach by supporting modern web-development tools like Git, Hugo and Jekyll. Forestry.io is a small team, led by engineers, and based in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island. We're looking for a Full-stack Developer who wants to build a truly world-class CMS, and we invite interested candidates to find out more about us at [Forestry.io](https://forestry.io).

### Position

Forestry.io is looking for a Growth Marketer to join the team. As a developer-centric product, we're looking for someone who understands developers. The ideal candidate will work with the leadership team to develop and implement a marketing strategy.

### Work Culture

You are a growth strategist probably known as being a bit geeky: analytical, data driven, and highly motivated by metrics. You are eager to join a team as a marketer of a globally competitive product. You have a passion for the web and are enticed by the opportunity to connect millions of people to a transformational CMS. You are a creative problem solver with an intuition for customer profiling and analytics. You are at ease drawing conclusions from market research to provide insights to the team for product development. You are self-motivated and can self-direct and enjoy taking the initiative on a project, while also appreciating that a team can be greater than the sum of its parts. You can communicate well with devs, non-devs, corporate clients and day-to-day customers. You are happy to receive feedback as an opportunity to learn and grow, and likewise, you take the opportunity to offer constructive input to your teammates. Unfazed by the occasional inglorious task (customer support, writing documentation, etc), you assume responsibility and will work outside of your comfort zone to both grow professionally and build something exceptional with your team.

### Responsibilities

* Work with leadership, other executive stakeholders, and the Forestry.io team to establish growth strategies to support Forestry.io's revenue goals.
* Analyze all aspects of Forestry.io's conversion funnel and identify the largest areas for improvement and implement strategies to capitalize on these opportunities.
* 

### Qualifications

* Minimum 2 years' experience in growth marketing or related field
* Samples and results of past marketing projects
* References from past marketing projects
* Bachelor's degree in related field considered an asset
* Familiarity with front-end development would be an asset

### Compensation

The salary range for this position is $60,000 to $80,000 CAD commensurate with experience and location. Other benefits include generous vacation time, a flexible work schedule, option of remote work, team retreats, and health benefits.

Additionally, a commission-based compensation program based on key metrics (acquisition, retention) may be explored.

### How to apply

Please submit a resum√©, cover letter and responses to the questions below as one single PDF to [jobs@forestry.io](mailto:jobs@forestry.io).

Included in your application's PDF, please answer the following questions in 500 words or less (total):

* What is your favourite company (that you are a customer of) and why?
* Tell us about your most satisfying marketing-related achievement?

### Additional Information

* Acquired thousands of users from around the world
* Formed an awesome team
* Took part in Techstars NYC
* Built a network of tech founders/mentors

Now we're focused on developing the product and growing the business. Join us.
