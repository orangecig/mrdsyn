[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/forestryio/forestry.io.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/forestryio/forestry.io)

# Forestry Website
This site wraps [Hugo](gohugo.io) with [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) as your asset pipeline.

[PostCSS](http://postcss.org/) and [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) + [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) are used for CSS and JS compiling & transpiling.

[ImageMin](https://github.com/imagemin/imagemin) is used to optimize and compress images, and [SVG Sprite](https://github.com/jkphl/svg-sprite) is used to generate a SVG Sprite.

[BrowserSync](https://www.browsersync.io/) is used for providing a modern local development experience, allowing you to preview your site on multiple devices in sync.

[BrowsersList](https://github.com/ai/browserslist) is used for configuring Browser support.

# Installation

## Prerequisites
To use Gulp, you must have [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) installed.

## Setup

Once the prerequisites are installed, clone the repository to your local machine, and then run:

```
npm install
```

This will install Hugo as well as all of the Node dependencies needed to run your Hugo environment. This may take a little while!

# Development
All development tasks are performed using npm run. See `"scripts"` in [package.json](/package.json) for a full list of commands.

## Local Development
Local development is powered by BrowserSync, you will be able to develop sites rapidly through:

- A local development server at `http://localhost:3000/`.
- Automatic CSS & JS updates without reloading the page
- Automatic page reloads when content is changed

Running the local development server is as simple as running:

```
npm start
```

*This will display all draft, future-dated, or expired content, which is not included in your production build.*

If you'd like to develop with the site as it will appear in production, run:

```
npm run preview
```

## Production Build

To generate a final production build on your local machine you can run:

```
npm run build
```
*The fresh production build of your site will end up in the `dist/` directory.*

## Environment Variables
This project uses environment variables to handle the CircleCI deployment, as well as the Algolia index.

For local development, environment variables can be included in `.env.js`. See `.env.js.stub` for the available variables.

     ├── scss              // Sass source files to be compiled to /css/

     └── img               // Unoptimized raw image source files to be compiled to /img/
```

# Images
Images found in `src/img/` will be optimized and compressed and sent to `hugo/static/img/` for usage in your layouts and content.

# Inline SVG
Any SVGs found in `src/img/` will be combined into a single SVG Sprite at `hugo/static/svg/sprite.symbol.svg`

This can then be used in layouts as a Hugo partial:

```
{{ partial "svg" (dict "id" "logos--github" "class" "example-class" "width" "64" "height" "64") }}
```

# Algolia
Algolia powers the search for the documentation and the blog. The Algolia index is generated by Hugo, using [custom output formats](https://gohugo.io/templates/output-formats/). 

These are found in `config.toml`:

- `outputformats.Algolia`: the Algolia search index
- `outputformats.OpenSearch`: the [OpenSearch.org](http://www.opensearch.org/Home) template for notifying search engines about the site search

Any Hugo section can have an index generated for it by adding the following to the front matter:

```
outputs:
- algolia
- opensearch
```

The templates for generating the search indexes and open search definitions are:

- `layouts/_default/list.algolia.json`
- `layouts/_default/list.opensearch.xml`

They are automatically added to the head of the page in `layouts/partials/head.html`

# S3 Redirects
[Hugo aliases](https://gohugo.io/content-management/urls/#aliases) handles the sites redirects.  A valid S3 redirects configuration is generated using [custom output formats](https://gohugo.io/templates/output-formats/).

This is found in `config.toml`:

- `outputformats.Redirects`: the redirects output format

Any Hugo section can have an index generated for it's children by adding the following to the front matter:

```
outputs:
- redirects
```

Redirects generated using `content/_index.md` to generate redirects for all pages on the site.

# Testing & Code Quality
This boilerplate comes with standard [ESLint](https://eslint.org/), [StyleLint](https://github.com/stylelint/stylelint), and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) configurations that will lint and clean your CSS and JS for errors or common style issues, which work with most popular IDEs.

Popular IDE plugins:
- **Visual Studio Code**
  - [`prettier-vscode`](https://github.com/prettier/prettier-vscode/)
  - [`vscode-eslint`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-eslint/)
  - [`vscode-stylelint`](https://github.com/shinnn/vscode-stylelint)
- **Atom**
  - [`prettier-atom`](https://atom.io/packages/prettier-atom)
  - [`linter-eslint`](https://atom.io/packages/linter-eslint)
  - [`linter-stylelint`](https://atom.io/packages/linter-stylelint)

The tests can also be run from the command line:

- **JS:** `npm run eslint`
- **CSS:** `npm run stylelint`

If you want to automatically fix lint errors, you can do this from the command line as well:

- **JS:** `npm run eslint:fix`
- **CSS:** `npm run stylelint:fix`

# Cleanup

This boilerplate is self-cleaning, and will remove the production `dist/` and development `.tmp/` folders every time a command is run to ensure that their contents are always up to date.

If you wish to manually cleanup, run:

```
npm run clean
```

# Configuration
All build tasks are handled by Gulp and are located in `gulpfile.babel.js`. All parts of the build are configurable in discrete files to make management easy.

## Paths
All build source and destination paths can be configured from `gulp.config.js`.

## Hugo
The build commands for Hugo can be configured from `gulp.config.js`. Build commands are set based on the `GENERATOR_ARGS` environment variable, and will fallback to `NODE_ENV` if not provided.

Four options are available:
- `default`: the default build commands that are always run
- `development`: additional build commands for the development server
- `preview`: the additional build commands for the development server when serving production build
- `production`: additional build commands for production builds and preview server

## BrowserSync Development Server
The configuration for BrowserSync is found in `browsersync.config.js`

## CSS/SASS
The configuration for PostCSS is found in `postcss.config.js`

## Javascript
The configuration for Webpack is found in `webpack.config.js`

## Browser support
Both PostCSS and Webpack use `.browserslistrc` to decide on browser support when compiling.

# Tips & Resources

- To learn about how to develop with Hugo, see [Hugo's documentation](http://gohugo.io/getting-started/directory-structure/)
- To learn how to use Hugo's templating system, see the [documentation](http://gohugo.io/templates/introduction/)
- Static files should be stored in the `hugo/static/` folder as they should appear in the built site
  *E.g, a CNAME file should be stored at `hugo/static/CNAME` to become `/CNAME`*
- Javascript files are compiled from the root of `src/js/` to `js/{filename}.js`
  - Javascript can be written using ES6, supporting `require()` and `import` statements from npm packages and local JS files
- CSS files are compiled from the root of `src/css/` to `css/{filename}.css`
  - Import statements are resolved and included in the compiled CSS files
- For compatibility with Forestry or other CMSs, ensure that compiled CSS and JS files in the `hugo/` folder are always committed
- Environment variables are provided to your templates, which can be accessed in templates as follows: `{{ getenv "HUGO_ENV" }}`
  - For development pipelines, this is equal to `development`
  - For production pipelines, this is equal to `production`
  - For Forestry's in-app preview feature, this is equal to `staging`
